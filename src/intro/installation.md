# Installing Pop!_OS

You can try or install Pop!_OS by booting a live disk.

## Minimum Requirements

First, ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements to run Pop!_OS:

- **CPU:** 64-bit processor
    - x86_64 (AMD64) architecture
    - ARM v8 architecture (Raspberri Pi 4 image only)
- **RAM:** 4GB recommended
- **Storage:**
    - **Capacity:** 16GB or more
    - **Speed:** USB 3 or faster

You will also need a USB storage drive **at least 8GB large** to perform the installation.

## Creating a Live Disk

Visit the [Pop!_OS homepage](https://pop.system76.com/), click `Download`, and select your edition:

- **Download 22.04 LTS:** For computers with only Intel or AMD graphics.
- **Download 22.04 LTS (NVIDIA):** For computers with NVIDIA graphics.
- **Download 22.04 (Ras Pi 4):** For the Raspberry Pi 4.

Once the `.iso` file is finished downloading, flash it to your USB storage drive using an app of your choice. Popsicle and Etcher are shown as examples below. Flashing the `.iso` image to your USB drive **will erase the USB drive.**

### Popsicle (Linux)

If you're already running Linux, [download the latest release of Popsicle](https://github.com/pop-os/popsicle/releases/latest) in AppImage format. (Pop!_OS has Popsicle preinstalled.)

### Etcher (any OS)

If you're running another OS (such as Windows or macOS), you can use an alternative program such as [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
