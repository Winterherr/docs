# Configuring Webcams

Pop!\_OS will automatically detect most USB webcam models upon connection.

## Disabling and Enabling Webcams

You can disable your webcam by press `Fn` + `F10`. Which disables the webcam USB bus at the device level. Press `Fn` + `F10` to re-enable the webcam, and then restart any application(s) that were using the webcam at the time it was disabled.

## Webcam Compatibility

Pop!\_OS uses the USB Video Class (UVC) device driver for Linux. Devices supported by this driver are [listed on the UVC driver's site](http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/).

## Installing Cheese

Test your webcam functionality using [Cheese](https://github.com/GNOME/cheese). Cheese is an open-source webcam application for Linux available for installation in the [Pop!\_Shop](manage-apps/using-pop-shop.md).
