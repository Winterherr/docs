## Nightlight

Nightlight prevents eye strain and sleeplessness by reducing exposure to blue light.

>**Note**: Opening the Terminal with `Super` + `T` and entering the `xrandr -o normal` command will return a display to `Lanscape` orientation. This can be useful if mouse clicks do not register correctly on a flipped display.

### Resolution

Resolution is the number of length-by-width pixels used to render content on a display. Higher resolution values provide finer image detail. The options available for this setting are dependant on the resolutions supported by your display. A display's native resolution is the actual number of pixels available on the display, and will provide the clearest possible image.

### Refresh Rate

Refresh rate refers to the number of times per second that the image is updated on the display. A higher refresh rate will make the motion of objects on the screen appear smoother. The available refresh rate options depend on the refresh rates supported by your display.

### Scale

Increasing the scale percentage will make visual elements larger, but use more screen real-estate. Decreasing the display percentage will make visual elements smaller, but allow more objects to be displayed on the screen. Default scaling options multiply by whole numbers.

Example of a display at 100% scale:

Example of a display at 200% scale:

>**Note**: [Accessibility features](/customize-pop/accessibility-seeing.md) allow you to zoom into sections of the screen using the mouse, make text bigger, and enable high contrast mode for better visibility.

### Fractional Scaling

Enable `Fractional Scaling` to access scaling options that do not multiply object scaling by whole numbers.
